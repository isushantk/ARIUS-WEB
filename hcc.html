            <p> This project contains various things explained below - <br>
              <strong>Dashboard/Homepage:</strong>
Upon accessing the Hospital Management System, users (doctors, students, receptionists) are greeted with a dashboard or homepage that provides an overview of the system's features. It could display relevant statistics, news, and important announcements.
<br>
<strong>User Authentication:</strong>
Users are required to log in or sign up to access the system. This ensures that only authorized personnel can use the system and access sensitive patient data.
<br>
<strong>Doctor Interface:</strong>
The doctor interface allows registered doctors to manage their appointments and view patient medical records. Key features include:
<br>
<strong>Appointment Scheduling: </strong>Doctors can view their upcoming appointments and schedule new appointments with patients.<br>
<strong>Medical Records Access:</strong> Doctors can access and update patient medical records, including diagnoses, treatments, and prescriptions.<br>
<strong>Patient Search:</strong> Doctors can search for specific patients and access their medical histories.<br>
<strong>Receptionist Interface:</strong>
The receptionist interface allows receptionists to manage appointments and handle patient-related tasks. Key features include:
<br>
<strong>Appointment Management:</strong> Receptionists can schedule, reschedule, or cancel appointments based on doctor availability and patient preferences.<br>
<strong>Patient Registration: </strong>New patients can be registered into the system, capturing their basic details and medical history.<br>
<strong>Appointment Status: </strong>Receptionists can check the status of appointments and manage waiting lists.<br>
<strong>Student Interface:</strong>
The student interface is designed for students who are patients at the hospital or medical facility. Key features include:<br>

<strong>Medical Records Access: </strong>Students can view and download their medical records, including test results, prescriptions, and previous consultations.<br>
<strong>Appointment Booking:</strong> Students can request appointments with their preferred doctors through a user-friendly interface.<br>
<strong>Prescription Renewal:</strong> If required, students can request prescription renewals online.<br>
<strong>Medical Records Management:</strong></strong>
The system maintains a centralized database to store and manage patient medical records securely. It should comply with data protection regulations to ensure patient privacy.
<br>
<strong>Responsive Design:</strong>
The user interfaces are designed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to ensure they are responsive and accessible across different devices like desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
<br>
<strong>Appointment Notifications:</strong>
The system can send appointment reminders and notifications to both doctors and patients to minimize no-shows and improve efficiency.
<br>
<strong> and Privacy:</strong>
Security measures, such as encryption and secure user authentication, are implemented to protect patient data from unauthorized access.
<br>
<strong>Admin Interface:</strong>
An administrative interface may be included for managing user roles, system settings, and permissions.
<br>
Overall, our hospital management system project provides an efficient and convenient way for doctors, receptionists, and students to manage appointments and access medical records digitally, promoting streamlined healthcare processes and enhanced patient care.</p>
